# Projects

## Projects I've been working on this past semester: 
1. Publishing & Subscribing datas in py_pubsub (package inside `IntroWorkSpaceQuynhAnh` folder):
   - As a requirement for joining the software team at SDSU Mechatronics Club, I had to complete an introductory project that involved using `Ubuntu LTS 20.04` with `ROS2 Foxy` to create publisher and subscriber nodes in **Python**. These nodes update and convert Unix epoch time to human-readable time at 5-second intervals.
2. Writing MIPS program that does three things:
   - Mapping pixels from a monochromatic image to another image that contains only pixel values of `0` (white) or `255` (black) using a buffer
   - Transforming original image pixels through `rotation`, `shearing`, and `scaling`
   - Encrypting image pixels using `Caeser cipher` cryptography
3. GUI-Controlled Robot Submarine
   - Developed a user-friendly GUI using `Qt Creator` to enable seamless interaction with the robot's core through ROS2.
   - Streamlined communication for non-software team members by integrating `ROS nodes`, `PID controls` and more within the interface.
