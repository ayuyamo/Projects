# Projects

## Projects I've been working on in the past year: 
1. Publishing & Subscribing datas in py_pubsub (package inside `IntroWorkSpaceQuynhAnh` folder):
   - As a requirement for joining the software team at SDSU Mechatronics Club, I had to complete an introductory project that involved using `Ubuntu LTS 20.04` with `ROS2 Foxy` to create publisher and subscriber nodes in **Python**. These nodes update and convert Unix epoch time to human-readable time at 5-second intervals.
