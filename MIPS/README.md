# Image Trasnformation

### 1. Monochrome to Binary Pixel Mapping
- Mapping pixels from a monochromatic image to another image that contains only pixel values of 0 (white) or 255 (black) using a buffer

### 2. Image Pixel Transformation: Rotation, Shearing, and Scaling
- Transforming original image pixels through rotation, shearing, and scaling

### 3. Image Pixel Encryption with Caesar Cipher
- Encrypting image pixels using Caeser cipher cryptography
